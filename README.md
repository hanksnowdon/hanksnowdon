📊 I'm a data scientist based in Seattle, currently working in the Seattle Mariners DS group. 

🚇 I spend a lot of time thinking about car dependency in the U.S. and how investments in active and public transport can improve our cities. I'm also a sports fanatic, and love applying my quantitative background to better understand sports at all levels.

🔗 Full code for many of the projects I've worked on can be found here on my GitHub profile, and additional project writeups can be found on my [portfolio site](https://hanksnowdon.github.io/Portfolio/).
