## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data scientist based in Chicago, currently studying in an applied data science master's program at UChicago.

I spend a lot of time thinking about car dependency in the U.S. and how investments in active and public transport can improve our cities. I'm also a sports fanatic, and love applying my quantitative background to better understand sports at all levels.

Full code for many of the projects I've worked on can be found here on my GitHub profile, and additional project writeups can be found on my personal portfolio site [here](https://hanksnowdon.github.io/Portfolio/). 

Feel free to reach out via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hank-snowdon-849588159/) or email at hanksnowdon@gmail.com.
